Concept Drift on the Web
========================

Concept drift refers to the change of meaning of concepts over
time. This repo contains several experiments to detect, model and
predict change of meaning of concepts over time in the Semantic Web,
i.e. on RDF/RDFS/SKOS/OWL datasets. Most of these have been developed
in the context of the [http://www.albertmeronyo.org/](autor's PhD).


Directories on this repo:

* `compressionSimilarity` contains a rough implementation of
**LeanOM**, a lean ontology matching technique based on rough
compression of RDF serialized graphs
* `fca` contains few experiments with the Formal Concept Analysis
(FCA) framework of Rudolf Wille
* `oeml` contains a framework for Ontology Evolution using Machine
Learning (OEML), used in the paper **Predicting Concept Drift in
*Linked Data**
* `semStats` contains R scripts to detect extensional concept drift
  using paired difference tests on statistical distributions
