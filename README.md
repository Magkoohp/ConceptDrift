Concept Drift on the Web
========================

Concept drift referes to the change of meaning of concepts over
time. This repo contains several experiments to detect, model and
predict change (or stability) of meaning of concepts over time in the
Semantic Web, i.e. on RDF/RDFS/SKOS/OWL datasets.

For extended demos and results, see http://albertmeronyo.github.io/ConceptDrift

Directories on this repo:

* `compressionSimilarity` contains a rough implementation of
**LeanOM**, a lean ontology matching technique based on rough
compression of RDF serialized graphs
* `fca` contains few experiments with the Formal Concept Analysis
(FCA) framework of Rudolf Wille
* `oeml` contains a framework for Ontology Evolution using Machine
Learning (OEML)
* `semStats` contains R scripts to detect extensional concept drift
  using paired difference tests on statistical distributions
