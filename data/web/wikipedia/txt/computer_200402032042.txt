****** Computer ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
The word computer used to mean a person who computes. In current language, a
computer is any device used to process information according to a well-defined
procedure.
The word was originally used to describe people employed to do arithmetic
calculations, with or without mechanical aids, but was transferred to the
machines themselves. Originally, the information processing was almost
exclusively related to arithmetical problems, but modern computers are used for
many tasks unrelated to mathematics.
Within such a definition sit mechanical devices such as the slide_rule, the
gamut of mechanical_calculators from the abacus onwards, as well as all
contemporary electronic computers.
***** Definitions *****
However, the above definition includes many special-purpose devices that can
compute only one or a limited range of functions. When considering modern
computers, their most notable characteristic that distinguishes them from
earlier computing devices is that, given the right programming, any computer
can emulate the behaviour of any other (though perhaps limited by storage
capacity and at different speeds), and, indeed, it is believed that current
machines can emulate any future computing devices we invent (though undoubtedly
more slowly). In some sense, then, this threshold capability is a useful test
for identifying "general-purpose" computers from earlier special-purpose
devices. This "general-purpose" definition can be formalised into a requirement
that a certain machine must be able to emulate the behaviour of a universal
Turing_machine. Machines meeting this definition are referred to as Turing-
complete, and the first of them appeared in the 1940's in a flurry of
developments around the world. See the history_of_computing article for more
details of this period.
**** Embedded Computers ****
In the last 200 years or so, however, many household devices, notably including
video_game consoles but extending to mobile telephones, video_cassette
recorders, PDA's and myriad other household, industrial, automotive, and other
electronic devices, all contain computer-like circuitry capable of meeting the
above Turing-completeness requirement (with the proviso that the programming of
these devices is often hardwired into a ROM chip which would need to be
replaced to change the programming of the machine). These computers inside
other special-purpose devices are commonly referred to as "microcontrollers" or
"embedded_computers". Therefore, many restrict the definition of computers to
devices whose primary purpose is information processing rather than being a
part of a larger system such as a telephone, microwave_oven, or aircraft, and
can be adapted for a variety of purposes by the user without physical
modification. Mainframe_computers, minicomputers, and personal_computers are
the main types of computers meeting this definition.
**** Personal Computers ****
Finally, many people who are unfamiliar with other forms of computers use the
term exclusively to refer to personal_computers.
***** How Computers Work *****
While the technologies used in digital computers have changed dramatically
since the first computers of the 1940s (see History_of_computing_hardware for
more details), most still use the von_Neumann_architecture proposed in the
early 1940s by John_von_Neumann.
Von Neumann's architecture describes a computer with four main sections: the
Arithmetic_and_Logic_Unit (ALU), the control_circuitry, the memory, and the
input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are
interconnected by a bundle of wires, a "bus."
**** Memory ****
In this system, memory is a sequence of numbered "cells" or "pigeon holes,"
each containing a small piece of information. The information may be an
instruction to tell the computer what to do. The cell may contain data that the
computer needs to perform the instruction. Any slot may contain either, and
indeed what is at one time data might be instructions later.
In general, memory can be rewritten over millions of times - it is a scratchpad
rather than a stone tablet.
The size of each cell, and the number of cells, varies greatly from computer to
computer, and the technologies used to implement memory have varied greatly -
from electromechanical relays, to mercury-filled tubes (and later springs) in
which acoustic pulses were formed, to matrices of permanent magnets, to
individual transistors, to integrated circuits with millions of capacitors on a
single chip.
**** Processing ****
The arithmetic_and_logical_unit, or ALU, is the device that performs elementary
operations such as arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and so on),
logical operations (AND,_OR,_NOT), and comparison operations (for example,
comparing the contents of two "slots" for equality). This unit is where the
"real work" is done.
The control_unit keeps track of which slot contains the current instruction
that the computer is performing, telling the ALU what operation to perform and
retrieving the information (from the memory) that it needs to perform it, and
transfers the result back to the appropriate memory location. Once that occurs,
the control unit goes to the next instruction (typically located in the next
slot, unless the instruction is a jump instruction informing the computer that
the next instruction is located in another location).
**** Input and Output ****
The I/O allows the computer to obtain information from the outside world, and
send the results of its work back there. There are incredibly broad range of I/
O devices, from the familiar keyboards, monitors and floppy_disk drives, to the
more unusual such as webcams.
**** Instructions ****
The instructions discussed above are not the rich instructions of a human
language. A computer only has a limited number of well-defined, simple
instructions. Typical sorts of instructions supported by most computers are
"copy the contents of cell 123, and place the copy in cell 456", "add the
contents of cell 666 to cell 042, and place the result in cell 013", and "if
the contents of cell 999 are 0, your next instruction is at cell 345".
Instructions are represented within the computer as numbers - the code for
"copy" might be 001, for example. The particular instruction set that a
specific computer supports is known as that computer's machine_language. In
practice, people do not normally write the instructions for computers directly
in machine language but rather use a "high level" programming_language which is
then translated into the machine language automatically by special computer
programs (interpreters and compilers). Some programming languages map very
closely to the machine language, such as assembler (low level languages); at
the other end, languages like Prolog are based on abstract principles far
removed from the details of the machine's actual operation (high level
languages).
**** Architecture ****
Contemporary computers put the ALU and control_unit into a single integrated
circuit known as the Central_Processing_Unit or CPU. Typically, the computer's
memory is located on a few small integrated circuits near the CPU. The
overwhelming majority of the computer's mass is either ancilliary systems (for
instance, to supply electrical power) or I/O devices.
Some larger computers differ from the above model in one major respect - they
have multiple CPUs and control units working simultaneously. Additionally, a
few computers, used mainly for research purposes and scientific computing, have
differed significantly from the above model, but they have found little
commercial application.
The functioning of a computer is therefore in principle quite straightforward.
The computer fetches instructions and data from its memory. The instructions
are executed, the results are stored, and the next instruction is fetched. This
procedure repeats until the computer is turned off.
**** Programs ****
Computer_programs are simply large lists of instructions for the computer to
execute, perhaps with tables of data. Many computer programs contain millions
of instructions, and many of those instructions are executed repeatedly. A
typical modern PC (in the year 2003) can execute around 2-3 billion
instructions per second. Computers do not gain their extraordinary capabilities
through the ability to execute complex instructions. Rather, they do millions
of simple instructions arranged by clever people, "programmers." Good
programmers develop sets of instructions to do common tasks (for instance, draw
a dot on screen) and then make those sets of instructions available to other
programmers.
Nowadays, most computers appear to execute several programs at the same time.
This is usually referred to as multitasking. In reality, the CPU executes
instructions from one program, then after a short period of time, it switches
to a second program and executes some of its instructions. This small interval
of time is often referred to as a time slice. This creates the illusion of
multiple programs being executed simultaneously by sharing the CPU's time
between the programs. This is similar to how a movie is simply a rapid
succession of still frames. The operating_system is the program that usually
controls this time sharing.
*** Operating System ***
The operating_system is a sort of catch-all of useful pieces of code. Whenever
some kind of computer code becomes sharable by many different types of computer
program, over many years, programmers eventually move it into the operating
system.
The operating system, decides which programs are run, when, and what resources
(such as memory or I/O) they get to use. The operating system also provides
services to other programs, such as code ("drivers") which allow programmers to
write programs for a machine without needing to know the intimate details of
all attached electronic devices.
***** Uses of computers *****
The first digital computers, with their large size and cost, mainly performed
scientific calculation. ENIAC, an early US computer originally designed to
calculate ballistics firing tables for artilery, calculated neutron cross-
sectional densities to see if the hydrogen_bomb would work properly (this
calculation, performed in December 1945 through January 1946 and involving over
a million punch_cards of data, showed the design then under consideration would
fail). The CSIR_Mk_I, the first Australian computer, evaluated rainfall
patterns for the catchment of the Snowy_Mountains_scheme, a large hydroelectric
generation project. Others were used in cryptanalysis, for example the world's
first programmable digital electronic computer, Colossus, built during World
War_II. However, early visionaries also anticipated that programming would
allow chess playing, moving pictures and other uses.
People in governments and large corporations also used computers to automate
many of the data collection and processing tasks previously performed by humans
- for example, maintaining and updating accounts and inventories. In academia,
scientists of all sorts began to use computers for their own analyses.
Continual reductions in the costs of computers saw them adopted by ever-smaller
organizations. Businesses, organizations, and governments often employ a large
number of small computers to accomplish tasks that were previously done by an
expensive, large mainframe computer. Collections of the smaller computers in
one location is referred to as a server_farm.
With the invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s, it became possible to
produce very inexpensive computers. Personal_computers became popular for many
tasks, including keeping books, writing and printing documents. Calculating
forecasts and other repetitive math with spreadsheets, communicating with e-
mail and, the Internet. However, computers' wide availability and easy
customization has seen them used for many other purposes.
At the same time, small computers, usually with fixed programming, began to
find their way into other devices such as home appliances, automobiles,
aeroplanes, and industrial equipment. These embedded processors controlled the
behaviour of such devices more easily, allowing more complex control behaviours
(for instance, the development of anti-lock_brakes in cars). By the start of
the twenty-first century, most electrical devices, most forms of powered
transport, and most factory production lines are controlled by computers. Most
engineers predict that this trend will continue.
***** The word "computer" *****
Over the years there has been several slightly different meanings to the word
computer, and several different words for the thing we now usually call a
computer.
For instance "computer" was once commonly used to mean a person employed to do
arithmetic calculations, with or without mechanical aids. According to the
Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology, the word came into use in English in
1646 as a word for a "person who computes" and then by 1897 also for a
mechanical calculating machine. During World War II it referred e.g. to U.S.
and British servicewomen whose job it was to calculate the trajectories of
large artillery shells with such machines.
Charles_Babbage designed one of the first computing machines called the
Analytical_engine, but due to technological problems it was not built in his
lifetime. Various simple mechanical devices such as the slide_rule kind have
also been called computers. In some cases they were referred to as "analog
computers", as they represented numbers by continuous physical quantities
rather than by discrete binary digits. What are now called simply "computers"
were once commonly called "digital computers" to distinguish them from these
other devices (which are still used in the field of analog_signal_processing,
for example).
In thinking of other words for the computer, it is worth noting that in other
languages the word chosen does not always have the same literal meaning as the
English_language word. In French for example, the word is "ordinateur", which
means approximately "organizer", or "sorting machine". The Spanish word is
"ordenador" , with the same meaning, although in some countries they use the
anglicism computadora. In Italian, computer is "calcolatore", calculator,
emphasizing its computational uses over logical ones like sorting. In Swedish,
a computer is called "dator" from "data". At least in the 1950s, they were
called "matematikmaskin" ("mathematics machine"). In Chinese, a computer is
called "dian now" or an "electric brain". In English, other words and phrases
have been used, such as "data processing machine".
